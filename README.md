# unicode-categories
`unicode-categories` is a simple crate that adds many extensions
to the `char` type that allow for the querying of whether or not
a character is a member of a certain category of unicode characters.

More documentation and tests will be forthcoming as I get the time
but this should be ready to use right now.
